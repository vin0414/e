With the stars in the night
There are times when I just want to feel your embrace
In the cold night
I just cant believe that you are mine now
You were just a dream that I once knew
I never thought I would be right for you
I just cant compare you with anything in this world
You're all I need to be with forevermore
All those years, I've longed to hold you in my arms
I've been dreaming of you
Every night, I've been watching all the stars that fall down
Wishing you would be mine
I just cant believe that you are mine now
You were just a dream that I once knew
I never thought I would be right for you
I just cant compare you with anything in this world
You're all I need to be with forevermore
Time and again
There are these changes that we cannot end
As sure as time keeps going on and on
My love for you will be forevermore
Wishing you would be mine
I just cant believe that you are mine now
You were just a dream that I once knew
I never thought I would be right for you
I just cant compare you with anything in this world
As endless as forever
Our love will stay together
You're all I need to be with forever more
(As endless as forever
our love will stay together)
You're all I need
To be with forevermore...";}}
